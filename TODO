* Websocket mode: create a WS server, launch one or more browsers connecting to the server, the server end when all browsers
  have finished their tests. It allows scripting.
* BUG: test that asyncly timeout THEN asyncly throw ('uncaughtError' is throwed during the next test, turning it to a fail)
* package.json options
* this.parallel() (in suite context): run all test in this suite in parallel



Mocha compatibility:

* this.retry()
